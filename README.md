         Django Test
--------------------------------------------------

This project uses Django v1.5 and Python 2.7.
You can login and see a list of people with name, e-mail and url.
You can't see the list of people if you are not logged.

User that can be used to login is: 

name: daniel
pass: daniel*

For user Authentication I've used default Django view
(django.contrib.auth.views.login)

CSS and templates are under "fabricadigital/fabricadigital/" 
to get a good organization of project.
